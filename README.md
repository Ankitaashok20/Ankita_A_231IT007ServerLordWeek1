# ServerLordWeek1


1. Fork this repository as ServerLordWeek1_Name_RollNo
2. Dockerise the python app and expose it on port 5050 using port mapping 
3. Make >2 instances of the application and create a docker network using docker-compose containing all the instances and a nginx proxy that distributes the load and is visible on port 80 of host machine
4. Start with a round robin algorithm for load balancing and explore other options
5. What algorithm do you think will best suit the needs of a multi tenant SAAS like our cron job manager application? Give your justification in the README.
6. Give a demonstration of the whole set-up (steps 3-5) through screen shots and brief explanations.
